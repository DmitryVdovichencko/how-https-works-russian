Certificate Authorities


A certificate authority (CA) is a third-party organization with 3 main objectives:

3. Providing proof that the certificate is valid.


You might have heard of Symantec, Comodo, or Let's Encrypt, among others.


Becoming a CA is an intense task of security requirements and audits.

You need to be trusted to be accepted into a root store.

A root store is basically a database of trusted CAs.

Apple, Windows, and Mozilla run their own root stores that they pre-install in your computer or device.


Which certificate should you buy? You have basically 3 flavors.

Domain validated. The certificate just verifies the domain name, and nothing else. You probably need this one.

Organization validated. The certificate requires the validation and manual verification of the organization behind the certificate.

When a CA issues a certificate, they sign the certificate with their root certificate pre-installed in the root store.

Most of the time it's an intermediate certificate signed with a root certificate.


If a cat-astrophy would occur and the root certificate is compromised, it's easier to revoke the intermediate certificates, since the root certificates are installed on each device.


Let's walk through how a certificate is validated. The process is based on a "chain of trust".


HOW


HTTPS


.WORKS


Your browser connects to a site via HTTPS and downloads the certificate.


HOW


HTTPS


.WORKS


The certificate is not a root certificate.


HOW

Your browser downloads the certificate that was used to sign the certificate on the site.

The entire certificate chain is trusted, and thus the site certificate is trusted as well.


In the event that the last certificate is not a root certificate, and there are no more certificates to download, the chain is untrusted.

But why use a certificate authority when you can self-sign your certificates?

A self-signed certificate provides the same level of encryption as one generated by an authority.

And there is no charge to self-sign your certificates!


Yes, but almost every browser checks that the certificate is issued by a trusted authority.

As such visitors are warned that the certificate cannot be trusted.

Self-signed certificates can be useful for testing, and intranets, but you should avoid using them on public sites.

A trusted certificate says: "Trust me, an authority verified me".
