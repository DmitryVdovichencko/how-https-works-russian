The differences between HTTPS, SSL, and TLS

## Picture-02

It's easy to confuse these terms and use them interchangeably.

## Picture-03

Let's look into each one and see how they differ.

## Picture-04

What's HTTPS?

## Picture-05

HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP: "HyperText Transfer Protocol".

## Picture-06

HTTP is the protocol used by your browser and web servers to communicate and exchange information.

## Picture-07

When that exchange of data is encrypted with SSL/TLS, then we call it HTTPS. The "S" stands for "Secure".

## Picture-08

OMG! Wait! Did I say SSL/TLS! Why?

## Picture-09

Because it's the precise way to talk about SSL and TLS.

## Picture-10

SSL stands for "Secure Sockets Layer". A protocol created by Netscape.

## Picture-11

SSL is a dinosaur by Internet standards. The first version was never released and version 2 launched with the browser Netscape 1.1 in 1995.

## Picture-12

Later that year Netscape released version 3 because version 2 had some major security problems.

## Picture-13

We were all happy cats until 1999. 

## Picture-14

Oops, I did it again.

## Picture-15

Netscape gave control of SSL protocol to the IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force.

## Picture-16

Before 1999 ended, IETF released TLS version 1.0 (Which was really SSL 3.1).

## Picture-17

SSL was renamed to TLS: "Transport Layer Security". Creating confusion and chaos still to this day.

## Picture-18

Thanks 1999.

## Picture-19

TLS 1.0 took off and version 1.1 was released in 2006.

## Picture-20

A couple of years later, in 2008, TLS 1.2 was released to address a few flaws and exploits.

## Picture-21

However, it's not until 2013 that browsers start to catch up and add support for TLS 1.2.

## Picture-22

To add to the confusion, SSL 3.0 was officially deprecated in 2015.

## Picture-23

tls 1.3 was approved in march 2018 and your browser might already support it. 

## Picture-24

TLS 1.3 brings great security improvements and removes old weaker features.

## Picture-25

No worries if your browser doesn't support it yet. TLS 1.2 is still the recommended version if you are reading this in Spring/Summer 2018.

## Picture-26

Let's recap.

## Picture-27

HTTPS is just the HTTP protocol but with data encryption using SSL/TLS.

## Picture-28

SSL is the original and now deprecated protocol created at Netscape in the mid 90s.

## Picture-29

TLS is the new protocol for secured encryption on the web maintained by IETF.

## Picture-30

And now you know the hiss-tory.
